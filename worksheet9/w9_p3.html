      <li>Compare projection shadows to shadow mapping by listing advantages and disadvantages of the two techniques.</li>

      <p>The <b>pros</b> of projection shadows are that it has a easy implementation and it is inexpensive to compute. However, it has the following <b>cons</b>: it works better on flat surfaces and it is difficult to use it in non-flat surfaces, and controlling the colour and transparency of the shadow is also hard because it is a compressed version of the object and not a real shadow.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, the shadow mapping <b>pro</b> is that each object that can be rendered can cast shadows and does not depend on finding the silhouette for the object. But the <b>con</b> is that it is more difficult to implement and it requires more computational power as it needs two different renders.</p>
